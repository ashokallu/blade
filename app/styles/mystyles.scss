// unable to load .css file into .scss file, so had to fallback to src file only which is .scss file.
// You can import .scss file from 'node_modules' by prefixing with a tilde '~', and its optional.

// It is now possible to import css files directly into your sass file.
// The syntax is the same as now - @import "your/path/to/the/file", without an extension after the file name. This will import your file directly. If you append *.css at the end, it will translate into the css rule @import url(...).
// In addition to importing .sass and .scss files, Sass can import plain old .css files. The only rule is that the import must not explicitly include the .css extension, because thatâ€™s used to indicate a plain CSS @import.
// For libsass (C/C++ implementation), import works for *.css the same way as for *.scss files. just omit the .css extension
// @import '~mdb-ui-kit/css/mdb.min.css';
// @import "mdb-ui-kit/src/scss/mdb.free.scss"; // correct // tilde '~' is optional
