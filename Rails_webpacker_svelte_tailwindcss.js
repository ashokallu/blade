/*
  The 'source_entry_path' property of ./config/webpacker.yml file is a directory name, which is a path relative to the 'source_path' of ./config/webpacker.yml file.
  By default, everything inside the 'source_entry_path' property of ./config/webpacker.yml is an entry point for webpack, which means, webpack in Rails is configured to output a bundle for every file in the 'source_entry_path' directory, and this 'source_entry_path' property can have nested directories, and even the files in the nested directies of 'source_entry_path' directory are treated as a entry point file for webpack which will be built as a bundle, webpack will build a dependency graph for each entry point file, a bundle is built for each entry point file by resolving the dependency of that entry point file, and the final bundle name is configured to have the same name as the entry point file for which the bundle is built by webpack by resolving every dependency of the entry point file.
  The 'source_entry_path' directory should usually consist of only .js files, which are the source entry files, and they will be processed by webpack individually, and for every source entry file, which is a .js file, a bundle with .js is created after webpack resolves the dependencies of the source entry file from the dependency graph created by webpack to find the dependencies of the source entry file.
  The relative path of a .js file in the 'source_entry_path' property will be the argument that should be given to 'javascript_pack_tag' helper method of 'webpacker' gem to serve the bundle built from the source entry file, the file path without the .js extension can be given as argument to 'javascript_pack_tag' helper method.

// If you are using sveltejs, and if you have not set { emitCss: true } for 'options' property of the 'svelte-loader' loader in the './config/webpack/loaders/svelte.js' file, then, even though you have set 'extract_css' property to true in the './config/webpacker.yml', the css markup is not extracted for .svelte components, which means, if you have a .js file in the './app/javascript/packs' path, then, you can reference the bundle generated from this file by 'javascript_pack_tag', then .css will not be extracted to a .css file with the same name in the './public/packs/css/' folder because the bundle has .svelte component, but 'options' property of the 'svelte-loader' loader configuration does not have { emitCss: true } in the 'options' property, so, 'stylesheet_pack_tag' for the .js module that does not have any css module imported from it, but only references .svelte components, as it has no markup in it, a .css file for this module is not generated in './public/packs/css/' folder, and if you give the .js module's bundle in 'stylesheet_pack_tag' helper method, the method throws an error.
// If you want to extract css markup from .svelte component into a seperate .css files into a .css file generated for the bundle which imports .svelte components in it, then, you must set { emitCss: true } for 'options' property of the 'svelte-loader' loader in the './config/webpack/loaders/svelte.js' file, then, for all components in a bundle, the css from style element is extracted into a .css file with the bundle path into './public/packs/css/' folder, and you can give the bundle path relative to './app/javascript/packs' path, in the 'stylesheet_pack_tag' helper method, and then, the .css file in the './public/packs/css/' folder that has the extracted markup for the bundle is served to the browser.
